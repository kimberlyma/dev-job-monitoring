# Overview
The dev-job-monitoring repository provides a minimal example of how to use the Databricks Python SDK. It serves as a reference point for building your own project. Please note that this is not a complete stand-alone project and further development is to be determined (TBD).

This repository includes an example referenced in a blog post, demonstrating how to connect to a workspace, list all jobs, analyze their settings, and apply new settings using the update_new_settings function.

Friendly reminder to be cautious when updating resources in your Workspace. That is the primary reason the code begins at logging and testing, before implementing any updates.

# Branches
There are two main branches in this repository:
1. `main`: Contains the primary codebase.
2. `notebook`: Contains the notebook example.
